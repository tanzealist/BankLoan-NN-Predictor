# Breaking Down Barriers with Neural Networks: Predicting Outcomes with Ease

## Overview
This project explores the power of neural networks in predicting outcomes based on data. By applying simple feed-forward neural models, we strive to understand the nuances of the Loan dataset and predict decisions effectively.

## Problem Description
The challenge was to apply neural network models to accurately predict outcomes from a given dataset. We aimed to leverage neural networks with regularization and Adam optimizer to classify data based on accuracy.

## Technical Approach
- Implemented feed-forward neural network models with varying hidden layers.
- Trained using binary cross-entropy and mean squared error loss with Adam optimizer.
- Evaluated models' performance using accuracy, loss, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

## Data Analysis
Data analysis was conducted to understand feature correlations and distribution within the Loan dataset, influencing the neural network's decision-making process.
